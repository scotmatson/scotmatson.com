			<p>Being of a child of the 80’s, my youth was heavily influenced by the rapid development of the gaming industry. I was exposed early-on to computer gaming with, Commodore 64, Texas Instruments, and the Apple IIgs. As console gaming emerged I often found myself spending countless hours exploring worlds which only had previously existed in my dreams. Intellivision, Nintendo, Sega, Turbo Graphix all became household names for my friends and I. It wasn’t until I entered High School and moved away from my hometown that I truly lost myself into an evolving digital landscape. A text-based style of gaming known as a MUD (Multi-User-Dungeon) -which to me was the purest form of digital gaming- captivated me… I was hooked.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Games these days heavily focus on graphics and generally make no attempt to use the players own imagination. Fast paced, little community involvement or commitment, and overly-competitive are trends I commonly see. Quality has been dismissed for a polished presentation and gore, and while text-based games may be long retired, it is no excuse for mass-marketing unimaginative over-hyped cash cows that rob gamers of time and money.</p>
			<br>
			<p>While I have yet to develop games of my own I feel it is only a matter of time. My foundation in computers and web development has inspired me to make a future commitment to online open-sourced gaming to reintroduce my peers to a style of gaming that has been long forgotten and provide kids an alternative to the overpriced cookie-cutter games which exist today.</p>

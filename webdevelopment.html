			<p>Web development is my current foundation and inspiration for a career change towards computers and technology. Despite growing up in an environment that always afforded me access to some of the most modern computing systems of the time period, I often found myself not interested in understanding the technology itself but rather a means to an end. I can’t say when exactly I began to understand that complex languages were behind the software I used on a daily basis and the hardware was developed by nanotechnologies which few can wrap their heads around, but when I had reached this realization I assumed that joining this ‘elite’ community was out of my reach. Fortunately I have been afforded influential mentors which have demystified the code which many of my friends now associate with The Matrix.</p>
			<br>
			<p>With so many tools and short-cuts available such as code libraries and content management systems, I personally believe as I become proficient in programming languages,  I intend on making it a priority to build customized applications and web sites through standardized legible code that will remain functional but easily read and altered as necessary.</p>

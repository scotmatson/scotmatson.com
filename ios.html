			<p>I have been using Apple products as long as I can remember from the ancient Apple IIgs, Macintosh, iMac, PowerBook and finally the iPhone 3GS. I’m sure I’ve left out a few computing systems but it only makes sense to me as I become more versed in programming that I begin to develop applications for Apples most successful platforms of them all, the iPhone and iPad. Ironically this is the first time in my life where I have decided to not purchase apple products and currently use a Windows based computer and Android based smart phone, this is largely in part due to attempting to remain economical since Apple’s target market is in fact for the professional designers and developer and they have a price tag to prove it. I also feel that limiting me to Apple’s platform will also hinder my own professional development as well. With plans to begin exploring Objective-C and iOS development within the year I expect to start showcasing my work here soon.</p>

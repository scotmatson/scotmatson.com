			<p>While professional photographers may take years to understand lighting, placement, color, development, and use of digital photo technology, amateurs like me can still manage to find an equal amount of enjoyment by this form of artistic expression. Unlike many other creative processes, being a photographer really only has one requirement, having access to a camera, and perhaps being at the right place at the right time. Years ago in high school I had been enrolled in photography course where had learned how to properly focus my camera, take advantage of multiple lenses and also develop my own film but once again technology has changed the landscape here as well. Everyone with a modern day smart phone is now an amateur photographer, film is seemingly limitless, and exposure is instantaneous.</p>

			<p>While not taken with the highest quality equipment (yet), as with my art, I have a strong appreciation for photography and find that to be a successful designer one must learn to embrace various forms of expression.</p>

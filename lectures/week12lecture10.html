				<ul>
					<li>Variables should be meaningful and be written on a proper casing based upon the given language (ie, camelcase in JavaScript)</li>
					<li>Braces are often opened on the same line as the keyword and closed on a line of their own. Although some languages place both opening and closing curly braces on a line of their own.</li>

				<h2>Writing pseudocode</h2>

				<p>Pseudocode is a way of writing computer code in plain english on paper, or a whiteboard etc... It is used in the earliest stages of program development to easily design code structure. There are no syntax rules and clarity should be strongly emphasized. Pseudocode can help visualize developer goals and uncover knowledge gaps in our understanding of a language.</p>

					<h2>Input/output and persistence</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Computers have always had a foundation in user input and computer output. As technology has advanced this definition has grown beyond a linear process and is now more interactive. Because of this the abililty of information to persist has become increasingly important. Persistence refers to saving the state of a program for later use and depending on the programming language used, is supported differently. JavaScript tends to be more volitile than other languages and does not focus on retaining and saving information.</p>

					<h2>Reading and writing from the DOM</h2>
				</header>
				<p>JavaScript is a general scripting language rather than a general programming language. It lives and breaths on the web. It accomlishes its tasks through the DOM (Document Object Model). Each programming language is designed similarly, to function specifically in the medium they were designed for. Mobile applications for instance include code to make decisions on how to react when a phone rings while desktop applications on the other hand are designed to interact with a printer or a USB port.</p>

				<p>Looking more closely at the DOM, the document refers to a web page, objects reference the different pieces which make up a web page, and the model is the agreed upon terms used to describe the document, its objects, and also the relationship between them. The DOM is what is used to allow our scripts to reach into and manipulate our web sites.</p>

					<h2>Event driven programming</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Event driven programming is a method of programming which gives applications the ability to respond to user interaction. Interactions include typing on the keyboard, moving the mouse, clicking the mouse, placing the mouse cursor over an element. When assigning an event handler, the common format is element.event where element refers to the element of a web site we want to react and the event is the user interaction. Following the assignment of the event handler is a function that executes code in response to the event.</p>

					<h2>Introduction to file I/O</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Standard JavaScript within a web page will not let you read or write files onto your hard drive due to poor security. However, for other languages where this is not as great of an issue, understanding how and why we read/write code to a hard drive is important. Simon continues this lecture showing the functionality of the programming language Ruby and how it goes about assigning the tasks of reading a file and writing to a file.</p>

					<h2>Introduction to debugging</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Professional programmers understand that part of the programming process includes making mistakes, it is inevitable. Coding is a cycle of entering multiple statements and functions followed by testing them for errors and correcting them. Errors in code break down to syntax errors and logic errors. Syntax errors refers to the format of the code it self while logic errors are errors due to code structure or arithmetic issues.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
				<h2>Tracing through a section of code</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Basic debugging exercise using a low-tech method referred to as tracing. In JavaScript, tracing involves placing alert messages throughought code to follow the path of the program. Using this method is an easy to to pinpoint the general location of errors which may be preventing a program from performing the desired action. In other languages, a trace method actually exists which is used for a similar purpose.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Understanding error messages</h2>
				</header> 
				<p>When being compiled, most programs will use specialized syntax to indicate where errors are located in code. JavaScript does not present error messages on a web site but within the JavaScript error console located in a browsers developer tools. The error messages often provide the line number where an error is located and also may present a general location on that line, most often though the syntax of error messages can be vague and difficult to understand when just starting out.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Using debuggers</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The most effective means of locating errors in code is by using a debugger program. For web development, programs such as FireBug are an extension of the browser which may be downloaded and installed as a plug-in. Debuggers work similarly to tracers and developer tools but have increased functionality which allows a programmer to see the code of a program as its actually running and follow it around. If errors occur the error messages tend to be more easily located and use more english-like syntax.</p>

			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Introduction to object-oriented languages</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Object-oriented programming(OOP) languages have only been around during the last 30 years. Prior to their development, procedural languages were used. A procedural language is essentially a long piece of code which combines data, logic, and functions. Object-oriented language is compiled of multiple objects which contain their own data and their own logic and can communicate between themselves. Objects represent the way we think about problems and are used to make programming easier.</p>

				<p>OOP uses classes and an object. A class is a blue-print which is well defined and is used to give a broad representation of data. When a class is defined it is done so by indicating specific attributes(properties) and behaviors(methods). An object is created as a representation of the class. This relationship is easily seen by referring to calico as an object of the cat class, ford as an object of the car class, and flower as an example of the plant class.</p>
			</article>				
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Using classes and objects</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The easiest way to become familiar with object-oriented languages is by using existing objects such as an Array object, or a Date object. When using objects, they typically will have get() and set() methods which allow us to input data and receive information in return. Pre-defined classes and objects do not always have to be used, new ones are being created by programmers all of the time.</p>

				<p>When using an object and it's methods, first the object must be defined. Depending on the type of object being defined, parameters may be required, otherwise a default constructor will be used. Once assigned to a variable, the variable which acts as an instance of the object may be used to get() or set() information or utilize other methods which are available to the particular object.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Reviewing object-oriented languages</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Because object-oriented programming is an idea, a lot of debate goes on about what requirements are necessary to be considered an object-oriented language. Often requirements include polymorphism, inheritence, abstraction, and encapsulation. Regardless, finding out which languages are object-oriented and learning about the number of pre-defined classes they have to offer and how to use them properly will save time in the long run as the work has been done for you.</p>

	<h2>My Experience</h2>

	<p>After last semester I'm fairly comfortable with using FirefoxFTP and HTML/CSS. Given, I don't have a lot of experience with building tables, I believe the key to learning how to program applications and develop websites comes down to understanding core concepts and knowing what to look for and how to find it.</p>

	<p>Oddly the most difficult part of building this was just the minor details of remember to path my images, ensure the images were all sized and named appropriately, and find time to do it! I snuck into the back of Todd's CIT15 class and did most of the work there because the FCC wifi is horrible! I'm on campus quite a bit so getting online can be a real pain sometimes.</p>

			</header>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Building with the if statement</h2>
				</header>
				<p>In many programming languages, including JavaScript, the if statement is used to give programs intelligence. It essentially state if a condition is true, then do something. When writing the if statement the condition being tested is placed with a set of parenthesis. Following the conditional statement we write the code that will be ran if the condition is true placed within a set of curly braces. This all breaks down to look like this.</p>
<pre>
	if (condition is true)
	{
	do this
	}
</pre>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
				<h2>Working with complex conditions</h2>
				</header>
				<p>This tutotorial introduces the if/else statement and also discusses nested if statements. The else clause is provides an alternative action to take if the if statement is false. A nested if statement allows additional actions to be taken if the condition is true.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Setting comparison operators</h2>
				</header>
				<p>A comparison operator is used to test the relationship between two variables. To test conditions, two or more parameters are tested against eachother using the conditional operators. These include &gt;(greater than), &lt;(lesser than), ==(equal to), !=(not equal to), ===(strict equal to), !==(strict not equal to), &gt;=(greater than or equal to), and &lt;=(lesser than or equal to).</p>

				<p>When more than one condition needs to be tested at the same time we can utilize the logical AND operator, indicated by a pair of ampersands where both conditions must be true, or we can use the logical OR operator, indicated by a pair of pipes where one condition or the other must be true.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Using the switch statement</h2>
				</header>
				<p>If multiple if/else statements are required, a shortcut known as the sswitch statement may be used to list several similar conditions to be tested. Rather that state if(condition true) do this multiple times you merely have to state switch(test condition) followed by multiple cases which are to be tested against.</p>
<pre>
	switch(test condition) 
	{ 
		case "check 1":
			do something;
			break;
		case "check2":
			do something;
			break;
		default
			do something;
	}
</pre>

					<h2>Breaking your code apart</h2>
				</header>
				<p>When large amounts of code are being written, it tends to become difficult to read as it can easily turn into a large block of text. By breaking apart the code into groups of related elements code becomes easier to read and write. In JavaScipt we call these blocks of code functions. A function is created as simple as taking a block of code, wrapping it within curly braces and giving it a name. This allows us to later access the function by name to perform a given task.</p>

<pre>
	function functionname(parameters)
	{
		the function body includes one or more statements
		which do something and often will return a value using
		the return statement.
	}
</pre>
			<p>Functions should be named in relation to the action they are to take. They should be defined at the top of the JavaScript file so they may be accessed easily. When used, functions are &quot;called&quot; by writing the function name followed by a set of parenthesis with an argument inside.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
				<h2>Creating and calling functions</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Simon gives a demonstration on creating a function, giving it multiple statements, and then calling it. Functions may be easily be called multiple times and more interseting may be nested in a process known as recursion.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Setting parameters and arguments</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Further discussion about functions. Covers differences between parameters and arguments. Introduces the return statement which allows data to be passed out of a function and placed into an assigned variable.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Understanding variable scope</h2>
				</header>
				<p>When creating functions, the variables declared inside the curly braces will not be recognized outside of the function. On the other hand, variables declared outside of the function may be used within the function. This behavior is referred to as scope. Two types of scopes exist, global and local. Global scope refers to variables that are accessible by all functions while local scope refers to the variables which lay within a function and may not be accessed by any other statements or functions.</p>

				<p>In JavaScope scope only refers to function. In other programming languages scope may refer to loops, methods, functions, etc...</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Splitting code into different files</h2>
				</header>
				<p>While splitting code up into functions helps keep code organized, it still can easily begin large and unorganized. Another step to take to keep code organized is to split code into multiple files. Using multiple files also makes it easier for multiple programmers to work on a project together. To access multiple files one only has to include multiple script tags in the HTML code. When using multiple files you should remain aware of any dependencies which might exist. For this reason, it is important to order your code properly so the most important files are loaded first, otherwise an error may occur.</p>

				<h1 id="iteration:writingloops">Iteration: Writing Loops</h1>
			</header>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Introduction to interation</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Iteration is a programming word that refers to loops. Loops will run statements a set number of times or while a set condition remains true.</p>

<pre>
	while (condition is true)
	{
		do something
	}
</pre>
		
				<p>Multiple types of loops exist. The while loop is the most basic type and will continue indefinately until the set condition is false. To ensure the loop ends an increment operator should be used.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
				<h2>Writing a while statement</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Topic covers proper set-up for writing a simple while loop. Key point includes off-by-one errors which is a common mistake by programmers. Two solutions are given and a warning to use one or the other as both will also result in an error in the calculation.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Creating a for loop</h2>
				</header>
				<p>While loops consist of an index, a condition, and an increment. The for loops is a shortcut used by programmers to bring these three elements together into a single parenthesis. The while loops and for loops do the same thing but the for loops is more readable and organized than the while loop.</p>

<pre>
	for(index, condition, increment)
	{
		do something
	}
</pre>
				<p>A less common loop exists called the do...while loop. The do...while loop ensures that the block of code is always executed at least once. In other types of loops the code may never be executed if the condition if immediately false.</p>

<pre>
	do
	{
		do something
	}
	while(condition is true)
</pre>

			</header>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Cleaning up with string concatenation</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Although JavaScript is a weakly typed language whos values contain numbers, strings, and booleans... it still cares about data types and will treat them all differently. Examples of this would be the addition of numbers versus the addition of strings. Numbers will produce a sum while a string will combine the numbers and list them sequentially. If we need to convert a string into a number, which commonly occurs when accepting user input, we use a built-in function called number() which turns a string into a number IF the string is a number. If the user variable is not a number, we can check this by using the function isNaN(). isNaN() accepts an argument and gives the results true if it is not a number. If we want to ask isNaN() if the variable is a number we can use the bang sign indicated by an excamation mark to negate isNaN, which essentially now asks if the variable is a number.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
				<h2>Finding patterns in strings</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Strings have properties such as length and case which can be be manipulated using methods or can just give us information about themselves. These various properties can complicate things when we are comparing two strings against eachother. Fortunately special comparison operators exist which allow us to compare two strings against each other while ignoring certain properties that they hold, such as casing. Other actions we can perform with strings include uncovering the position of characters or words within text, copying select segments of text and placing into a variable, or comparing their numerical values.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Introduction to regular expressions</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Many programming languages have regular expressions build into their languages which are strange sequences which can describe and match patterns in strings. There are two parts to regular expressions, creating an expression that describes the pattern and trying to apply it.</p>

				<p>Many methods exist to test for almost any number of patterns which may exist in a string of characters. This tool can be easily referenced when needed but often does not memorization. Understanding when and why they are used is most important.</p>

					<h2>Working with arrays</h2>
				</header>
				<p>an array is similar to a value except that is consists of multiple values contained in a single variable. In an array, each individual value has an index to identify its position, beginning with 0. When accessing the value of an array the variable named is used on conjuction with the index.</p>

<pre>
	var myArray = [];

	myArray[index1] = value1;
	myArray[index2] = value2;

	or...

	var myArray = [value1, value2, ...];
</pre>


			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
				<h2>Array behavior</h2>
				</header>
				<p>In JavaScript, array's are objects... this means they, like strings, have properties and methods. .length() will give us the length of an array, .reverse() will reverse all the elements of an array, .sort() will sort the array, .join() will combine the elements and turn them into a string, .pop() will detatch the last element of an array and return it as a value, .push() will add an element to the end of an array.</p>

				<p>Since so many methods exist, Simon recommends having a reference guide available such as the Mozilla Developers Network.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Iterating through collections</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Arrays should be thought of a collection of things. When sorting through an array it is common to utilize a while loop. Using the while loop it becomes an easy task to quickly access each index of an array.</p>

<pre>
	var myArray = [10, 20, test, TRUE, 99];
	var i = 0;

	while ( i &lt; myArray.length )
	{
		alert("The value is: " + myArray[i]);
		i++;
	}
</pre>
			</article>
			<article>
				<header>
					<h2>Collections in other languages</h2>
				</header>
				<p>While JavaScript allows mixed data types inside a single array, most programming language do not. It is more common to see an array of strings, or numbers, or booleans. Also, many languages give the option of creating a mutable or immutable arrays, also, rather than indexing by numerical values, an associative array is also possible. Associate arrays uses characters rather than numbers.</p>

			<p>This section is tentatively going to represent my future development of Java Applets but since I am still learning to program using the Java language donâ€™t expect to find content here anytime soon. While historically the use of Java to develop online applications has been a popular approach, various technologies have rapidly emerged or expanded in the last few years which have challenged this ideal, most formidably JavaScript and HTML5. You may return to this site and find that this section has been replaced with a collection of composed music or removed completely.  I am tentatively expecting to upload a completed project within the next year or two, or at least a work in project that I encourage others to participate in building with me, but in the meantime I will utilize this space to post links of Java related resources for others to take advantage of and perhaps help you find inspiration or complete projects of your own.</p>

			<p>Being the son of a graphic designer, I have always had a strong appreciation for various works of art and design. While my own path in life has led me astray from becoming a freehand illustrator or graphic designer, I still have strong ties to the creative process and often find myself exploring my own crude and unrefined artistic talents. This section exists solely to create a living timeline of my creative process from my youth through whatever current stage of life I am in. Often childish, violent, or cartoonish, I currently have no intentions on marketing any works presented on this page although it I am not entirely opposed to the idea either. Since I currently have a limited background using design software, everything presented here will most likely have been hand-drawn in haste on a sketch pad or perhaps a restaurant placemat. As time allows and my career in web design and develop evolve I more than likely will begin to build upon my talents and integrate my own style of art into the websites I design.</p>
